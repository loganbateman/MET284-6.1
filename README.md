# Structured Text Factorial Timer

This repository stores the Connected Components Workbench (CCW) structured text logic for the factorial-timed stack light exercise along with supporting documentation.

- `ST FILE` – structured text logic that counts qualified button presses, reads the counter CV as DINT, maps factorial values (1–7) to preset millisecond times, and drives the green stack light for that duration when the red pushbutton is held.
- `IO_Variables.md` – reference for the inputs, outputs, counters, timers, and internal variables expected in CCW.
- `CCW_Testing.md` – steps for verifying the program in CCW, including build, runtime checks, and troubleshooting tips.

> Note: CCW tooling is not available in this environment, so builds must be performed in CCW using the instructions above.
