# I/O and Variable Reference

| Symbol | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_IO_EM_DI_00` | BOOL (Digital Input) | Second pushbutton input used to qualify green-button counts before factorial processing. |
| `_IO_EM_DI_01` | BOOL (Digital Input) | Primary pushbutton input counted for factorial calculation and used to start the on-time timer. |
| `_IO_EM_DO_00` | BOOL (Digital Output) | Green stack light output driven by `TON_2.Q`. |
| `Counter1` | CTU Function Block | Counts `_IO_EM_DI_01` edges to detect the first press for activation logic. |
| `Counter2` | CTU Function Block | Generates a timed reset (`PB1_Reset`) for `Counter1` via `TON_1`. |
| `Counter3` | CTU Function Block | Counts qualified green button activations for factorial calculation. |
| `PB1_Activate` | BOOL | Counter1 output; goes TRUE after the initial pushbutton count. |
| `PB1_Reset` | BOOL | Reset pulse for `Counter1`, generated by `TON_1`. |
| `Final_Reset` | BOOL | Reset signal shared by all counters after the factorial-timed pulse completes. |
| `PB2_Num` | INT | Number of valid pushbutton activations used as the factorial input (converted from `Counter3.CV` via `DINT_TO_INT`). |
| `FactorialResult` | INT | Precomputed factorial of `PB2_Num` via a CASE lookup (1–7) to avoid `FOR` loop type issues. |
| `FactorialTime` | TIME | Millisecond duration derived directly from the factorial lookup (e.g., `PB2_Num = 5` → `T#120ms`). |
| `i` | INT | (Unused in lookup version) Loop index retained if you revert to a `FOR` loop factorial calculation. |
| `PB2_Num` | INT | Number of valid pushbutton activations used as the factorial input (clamped to the `INT` range). |
| `FactorialResult` | INT | Computed factorial of `PB2_Num` (limited to 1–7 to avoid `INT` overflow). |
| `FactorialTime` | TIME | Millisecond duration derived from `FactorialResult` (`T#1ms * FactorialResult`) for `TON_2`. |
| `i` | INT | Loop index for the factorial `FOR` loop. |
| `TON_1` | TON Function Block | 1-second timer that creates the reset pulse for `Counter1`. |
| `TON_2` | TON Function Block | Timer that keeps the green stack light on for the factorial-derived duration. |

> Note: Types reflect the expected CCW defaults for counters (`CTU`), timers (`TON`), and boolean/time/INT variables used in the structured text program.
