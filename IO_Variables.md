# I/O and Variable Reference

Use these Connected Components Workbench (CCW) symbols and data types with the current structured text logic in `ST FILE`. Only one declaration per name should exist—do not duplicate symbols with different data types.

| Symbol | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_IO_EM_DI_00` | BOOL (Digital Input) | Secondary pushbutton used to qualify valid green-button counts before factorial processing. |
| `_IO_EM_DI_01` | BOOL (Digital Input) | Primary pushbutton counted for factorial calculation and used to start the green stack-light timer. |
| `_IO_EM_DO_00` | BOOL (Digital Output) | Green stack light output driven by `TON_2.Q`. |
| `Counter1` | CTU Function Block | Counts `_IO_EM_DI_01` edges to detect the initial pushbutton press. |
| `Counter2` | CTU Function Block | Generates a timed reset (`PB1_Reset`) for `Counter1` via `TON_1`. |
| `Counter3` | CTU Function Block | Counts qualified green-button activations for the factorial calculation. |
| `PB1_Activate` | BOOL | Counter1 output; goes TRUE after the initial pushbutton count. |
| `PB1_Reset` | BOOL | Reset pulse for `Counter1`, generated by `TON_1`. |
| `Final_Reset` | BOOL | Reset signal shared by all counters after the factorial-timed pulse completes. |
| `PB2_Num` | INT | Number of valid pushbutton activations; assigned with `PB2_Num := TO_INT(Counter3.CV);` before factorial lookup. |
| `FactorialResult` | INT | Factorial value from the CASE lookup (1–7). |
| `FactorialTime` | TIME | Millisecond duration derived directly from the factorial lookup (e.g., `PB2_Num = 5` → `T#120ms`). Feed this into `TON_2.PT`. |
| `TON_1` | TON Function Block | 1-second timer that creates the reset pulse for `Counter1`. |
| `TON_2` | TON Function Block | Timer that keeps the green stack light on for the factorial-derived duration. Use `PT := FactorialTime`. |
| `i` | INT (optional) | Only needed if you switch back to a `FOR` loop factorial calculation; not used in the current CASE lookup. |

If your CCW project shows duplicate names with conflicting types (e.g., `FactorialResult` as both INT and DINT), delete the extra declarations so that each symbol appears once with the type listed above.
